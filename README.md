# Haskell Programs

To aid overall Haskell competency, here are some small and simple tasks inspired by exercises and programs from Graham Hutton's book, "Programming in Haskell." These are solutions to tasks designed to enhance understanding and proficiency in Haskell programming. Additionally, the tasks provide an opportunity to practice problem-solving and improve overall Haskell skills.

## Basics
The ```basics.hs``` script consists of a set of functions for numerical operations. It includes functions to calculate double and quadruple values of a given number, as well as to determine the smallest and largest values between two numbers. 

## Types and Classes
The ```typesclasses.hs``` script consists of:
- Task 1, a series of type declarations (```e1```, ```e2```, ```e3```, ```e4```, ```e5```, ```e6```, ```e7```, and ```e8```) are defined with specific values or functions. These declarations encompass various types such as lists of booleans, nested lists of integers, tuples, functions, and more.
- Task 2 introduces a set of functions (```copy```, ```one```, ```first```, ```second```, ```mult```) that showcase different functionalities, such as copying an input value, creating a list with a single element, extracting the first element from a tuple, selecting the second argument of a two-argument function, and defining a higher-order multiplication function.

## Functions
The ```functions.hs``` encompasses multiple approaches to Haskell programming:
- In Task 1, three functions (```second1```, ```second2```, and ```second3```) are defined to extract the second element from a list using different methods.
- Task 2 introduces three ```XOR``` functions (```xor1```, ```xor2```, and ```xor3```) that evaluate exclusive OR operations on boolean inputs through distinct approaches.
- Task 3's ```sumsqr``` calculates the sum of squares for integers up to a given value.
- Task 4's ```grid``` generates coordinate pairs within a specified range while excluding pairs with equal components.
- Task 5 implements the Euclidean algorithm (```euclid```) for finding the greatest common divisor.
- Task 6 offers an efficient list reversal function fastrev by utilizing an auxiliary recursive function ```rev```.
