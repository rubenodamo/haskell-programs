# Haskell Programs

To aid overall Haskell competency, here are some small and simple tasks inspired by exercises and programs from Graham Hutton's book, "Programming in Haskell." These are solutions to tasks designed to enhance understanding and proficiency in Haskell programming. Additionally, the tasks provide an opportunity to practice problem-solving and improve overall Haskell skills.
