# Haskell Programs

To aid overall Haskell competency, here are some small and simple tasks inspired by exercises and programs from Graham Hutton's book, "Programming in Haskell." These are solutions to tasks designed to enhance understanding and proficiency in Haskell programming. Additionally, the tasks provide an opportunity to practice problem-solving and improve overall Haskell skills.

## Program Descriptions
### Basics
The ```basics.hs``` script consists of a set of functions for numerical operations. It includes functions to calculate double and quadruple values of a given number, as well as to determine the smallest and largest values between two numbers. 

### Functions
The ```functions.hs``` encompasses multiple approaches to retrieve the second element from a list and provides several ways to implement the exclusive OR operation for boolean values. Furthermore, the project involves mathematical computations such as sum of squares, generating grid coordinates, and employing the Euclidean algorithm to determine the greatest common divisor. Lastly, the project includes an efficient function to reverse lists.
